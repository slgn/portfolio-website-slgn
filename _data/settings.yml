# About Section

blurb: >
  **Hi there!** I'm a content creator.
  I do anything from graphic design to short movies production. I am a future MSci Computer Science with
  Artificial Intelligence student, I am based in both Romania and the United Kingdom, and I have more than
  6 years experience. My goal is to create products and services that delight consumers and rive innovation
  across organizations. I am fascinated by the inherent complexities in the intersection of people and
  environments - how we live, work, and make accommodations everyday.
  **I am currently on a hiatus.**
